# SOM-ClusteringExample
Processing a dataset with Self-Organizing Map to visualize relation of each data points

1. Feature Selection

Only use specific features to maximize correlation between each data. 

2. Feature Extraction

Derived features from feature selection will be cleaned. We will also apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality. 

3. Create the SOM Architecture

4. Train data

5. Visualize results

After the training is complete, use matplotlib to visualize the clusters generated by the self-organizing map.
